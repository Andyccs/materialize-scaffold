# Materialize Scaffold

[Materialize](http://materializecss.com) is a modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design. The project provides some initial setups to work with the framework. However, no build automation is suggested by the project.

This project provides a scaffold using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) for build automation. Some features include:

- Concatenate and uglify scripts
- Concatenate and clean css codes
- Minify images using imagemin

# Getting Start


We install all dependencies, compiles all scripts, css, images, and HTML to `dist/` folder. Then, we open the `dist/index.html` in our favorite browser:

```Shell
$ npm installl
$ npm run gulp
$ open dist/index.html
```
